## About

This Coffee Machine project is a Python program that simulates a coffee vending machine. The project covers the following aspects:

- Menu with three coffee options: espresso, latte, and cappuccino.
- Ingredient management to check and update resource levels (water, milk, coffee, money).
- Coin handling to calculate change and manage transactions.
- User interaction for ordering and payment.

## How it Works

The Coffee Machine project follows these key steps:

1. The user selects a coffee option (espresso, latte, or cappuccino).
2. The program checks if there are enough ingredients to make the selected coffee.
3. The user enters coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies) to pay for the coffee.
4. The program calculates change if necessary and dispenses the coffee.
5. If there are insufficient ingredients or if the user's payment is not enough, appropriate messages are displayed.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `main.py` file in a Python environment.
